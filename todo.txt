TODO CodData

###  Thoughts  ###
##################
* när resetta sessionStorage.tempConfig. ska bort om man väljer nytt vapen iaf
* om pathen alls ska användas för att modda en config, eller om det ska göras enbart mha config service (eller en mix)
* gunsmith: how show stats (numbers)?
* how save/load custom mods?
 - web storage
 - save as it's done in game, i.e. "enter name", "update custom mod", "create new custom mod"?
 - how load it? from weapon select as in game?
* menu separate component
* think about how some pages would be displayed on smaller screens.
 - different menu on weapon-select
 - different button layout
* custom mod share link
* config template? able to apply a mod template on a weapon
* FAQ page (go a little nerdy with the weapon details. lock time (open bolt delay))



###  Prio 1  ###
################
* Config-Page (as main loadout page in game with only weapon configs)
 - Gunsmith (edit) button. Quick Stats on hover (attachments?, ADS, mag size, reload spd, bullet vel)?
 - main page
 - after selecting weapon, user should be redirected here
* weaponCard, stats separate component?
* Messages impacts layout
% Make it non static
* test with codgundata backend



###  Prio 2  ###
################
* buttons as a mini component since added sounds?
* mute sounds button. save as localStorage setting
* z-index on messages
* routerLink should trigger on mousedown to make it more responsive and emulate real game better
* improve layout dynamics
 - main layout - left margin should collapse as prio 1 if needed
 - layout improvements in gunsmith. should work better on narrower screens w/o changing layout
 - mobile friendly. different layout based on screen width
* remove attachment on 'r' when hovering button
* weapon images
* tabbable links / key (arrows) control
* button titles for hearing impaired
* back button
* able to name configurations
* page titles so you can navigate easier via browser back/forward buttons


###  Prio 3  ###
################
* different select, go-back sounds as in game
* Gunsmith real stats - real weapon name, cartridge. pic over cartridge with dimensions (inch + mm)
½ background image
- menu done
½ menu sounds
* scrollbar only full size when hovering the scrollable area
* graphical transition between pages. at least scrolling title
* more accurate font
