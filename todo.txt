TODO CodData

håller på med: 
- spara comparison config i sessionStorage med slot0....9 när man väljer en slot från listan i configurations
- gunsmith button configurations


###  Thoughts  ###
##################
* can save activeConfig in sessionStorage to make it possible to reload page. alt put slot nr in path
* mobile friendly layout som in game config (multiplayer/plunder)
* två klasser för ComparisonConfig och ArmoryConfig om behövs/klargör? kan i.s.f. ha en basklass de ärver från
* göra det tydligare i koden om en config är en comparison config eller en armory config
* när resetta sessionStorage.tempConfig. ska bort om man väljer nytt vapen iaf
* gunsmith: how show stats (numbers)?
* how save/load custom mods?
 - web storage
 - save as it's done in game, i.e. "enter name", "update custom mod", "create new custom mod"?
 - how load it? from weapon select as in game?
* think about how some pages would be displayed on smaller screens.
 - different menu (dropdown?)
 - main pages same layout as in game modding of loadouts
* custom mod share link
* make some weapons browsable (but not selectable in weapons-select)? colour in link should make it clear they're not selectable
* config template? able to apply a mod template on a weapon
* FAQ page (go a little nerdy with the weapon details. lock time (open bolt delay))



###  Prio 1  ###
################
* Config-Page (as main loadout page in game with only weapon configs)
 - Gunsmith (edit) button. Quick Stats on hover (attachments?, ADS, mag size, reload spd, bullet vel)?
 - able to delete configurations
 - some title for each card. e.g. "Slot 0"
* make sure goBackOnEscape() goes to the right site. maybe pass an argument instead and use router.navigate
 - problem is the history makes little sense then
* stats separate component
* remove messageService use inject the vars to the message component instead
* messages impacts layout
- z-index on messages
* test with codgundata backend


###  Prio 2  ###
################
* deal with attachments that blocks other attachments
* save weaponType in configs and use it to direct user to the same weapon-select/weaponType in configurations
 // - don't need to save comparisonSlot in config. key is enough
* buttons as a mini component since added sounds?
* mute sounds button. save as localStorage setting
* routerLink should trigger on mousedown to make it more responsive and emulate real game better
* improve layout dynamics
 - main layout - left margin should collapse as prio 1 if needed
 - layout improvements in gunsmith. should work better on narrower screens w/o changing layout
 - mobile friendly. different layout based on screen width
* remove attachment on 'r' when hovering button
* weapon images
* tabbable links / key (arrows) control
* button titles for hearing impaired
* back button
* able to name configurations
* page titles so you can navigate easier via browser back/forward buttons


###  Prio 3  ###
################
* different select, go-back sounds as in game
* Gunsmith real stats - real weapon name, cartridge. pic over cartridge with dimensions (inch + mm)
½ background image
- menu done
½ menu sounds
* scrollbar only full size when hovering the scrollable area
* graphical transition between pages. at least scrolling title
* more accurate font



###  Done  ###
##############
* sharable css variables
* Gunsmith layout
* Attachment-Select layout
* rename select-service
* Able to build configurations
* messages component
* Config-Page
 - main page
 - after selecting weapon, user should be redirected here
* Move link logic to component using weapon card instead of passing variables to the weapon card component
* Separate menu to its own component
